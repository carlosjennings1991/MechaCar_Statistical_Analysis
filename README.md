# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

For this first analysis, we perform a linear regression on our first data set to see if any variables correlate to increased miles per gallon.

Since multiple linear regressions are difficult to visualize, here are all the single multiple regressions.

As you can see above, none of the slopes are zero, each correlation has some slope, albeit some much more than others. 

For example, length is the greatest predictor of increase in MPG. Somewhat surprisingly, weight is not a great predictor of MPG.
